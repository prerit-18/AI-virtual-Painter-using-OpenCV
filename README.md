✨ Smart Voice Assistant 🧠🎙️

Introducing an integrated AI Voice Assistant (nicknamed Jarvis) that responds to intuitive voice commands — for a truly hands-free drawing experience.

🔓 Wake Word Activation

Just say “Jarvis” followed by your command to control the app without touching your mouse or keyboard.
✨ Unique Features 🎙️ AI Voice Assistant (Jarvis) Wake word activation: "Jarvis"

Understands commands like:

Jarvis clear – Clears the canvas

Jarvis red / blue / green / black – Changes drawing color

Jarvis eraser, rectangle, circle, line, draw – Switches tools

Jarvis help – Lists available voice commands

Jarvis quit – Exits the app

Real-time speech recognition via Google and text-to-speech feedback with pyttsx3

Runs in a dedicated background thread, allowing seamless multitasking

🛠️ How It Works

	•	Real-time speech recognition powered by Google Speech API
	•	Text-to-speech feedback using pyttsx3 (your assistant speaks back!)
	•	Runs smoothly in a separate background thread — no freezing or lag
	•	Supports natural interaction while drawing or selecting tools

🤖 Why PaintAI is Different Unlike traditional paint applications, PaintAI enables contactless interaction, making it perfect for touchless environments, educational demos, or creative experimentation. Its multi-modal input system (voice + gestures) is not only intuitive but also inclusive for users who may prefer voice or motion over physical input devices.
